        <h2>History</h2>
        <p id="history-text">
            Pateros Technological College (PTC) has a rich history that reflects its evolution from a small vocational school to a reputable institution of higher learning in the southern part of Metro Manila...
        </p>
        <div id="more-text" style="display: none;">
            <p>
                <strong>Foundation and Establishment</strong><br>
                Pateros Technological College was established in 1962 under the Republic Act No. 3847...
                which mandated the creation of vocational schools in different regions of the country.<br> The primary purpose of the institution was to provide technical and vocational training to the people of Pateros and its neighboring municipalities.<br>

                The initial goal of the college was to address the demand for skilled labor in the local community by offering courses that would prepare individuals for various technical jobs. It was originally known as Pateros Vocational School, serving as a public educational institution for secondary-level students who wished to gain specialized training in fields such as Automotive Technology, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Technology, and Dressmaking.<br><br>
                
                
                
                
                <strong>Development and Expansion (1960s – 1980s)</strong><br><br>
                
                In the following decades, Pateros Vocational School expanded its offerings to accommodate a growing number of students seeking technical education. In the 1970s and 1980s, the school began to diversify its programs, offering courses in Business Technology and Agricultural Technology, among others. This move was made to align with the evolving needs of the local economy and to provide students with a broader range of skills that could be applied to various industries.<br>
                
                During this period, the school also gained recognition from the Department of Education (DepEd) and later, from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), for its quality training and educational standards. The development of new classrooms, laboratories, and workshops helped accommodate the increasing student population, making it one of the region’s key educational institutions.<br><br>
                
                
                
                
                
                <strong>Transition to Pateros Technological College (1990s)</strong><br><br>
                
                In the early 1990s, the institution underwent a major transformation. With the growing demand for higher education in technical and vocational fields, the Pateros Vocational School transitioned into Pateros Technological College. This change was partly in response to the local government's desire to offer degree programs and more specialized technical courses.<br>
                
                As part of its upgrade, PTC began offering Bachelor’s Degree Programs in fields such as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), and Bachelor of Technical Teacher Education (BTTE). This move aimed to address the increasing need for well-rounded professionals in both technical and business sectors.<br>
                
                In the same period, the institution started to implement reforms in its curricula, focusing on the development of practical skills and industry-based learning to better prepare students for employment upon graduation.<br><br>
                
                
                
                
                
                
                <strong>with CHED and TESDA (2000s)</strong><br>
                
                By the early 2000s, Pateros Technological College solidified its reputation as a higher education institution by meeting the requirements of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for accreditation and by continuing its affiliation with TESDA. CHED’s involvement allowed PTC to offer more advanced and specialized academic programs, while TESDA’s accreditation helped the college maintain its strong focus on technical education.<br>
                
                During this time, the school introduced more modern facilities, such as computer labs, a library with online resources, and state-of-the-art technical training equipment. Partnerships with local industries and businesses also flourished, allowing students to participate in internships and on-the-job training (OJT), which significantly improved their employability.<br><br>
                
                
                
                
                <strong>Modernization and Technological Integration (2010s – Present)</strong><br>
                
                In the past decade, Pateros Technological College has undergone extensive modernization, embracing digital learning and improving its infrastructure to keep up with the needs of the new generation of students. In line with national policies, the college aligned its programs with the K-12 curriculum and made adjustments to its course offerings to meet global industry standards.<br>
                
                In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, PTC swiftly transitioned to online and hybrid learning formats, allowing students to continue their education without interruption. The shift towards digital education also involved expanding the college’s use of learning management systems (LMS) and integrating more online resources to enhance the learning experience.<br>
                
                In addition to academic programs, PTC has also offered short-term certification courses in areas such as Culinary Arts, Graphic Design, and Web Development. These courses have proven popular among working adults and those seeking to gain practical, job-ready skills in a short period of time.<br>
